Basic Features

Simply create your page and edit the content using a WYSIWYG editor - no additional syntax to learn

Create a new page using the new 'Create new page' element you can enable on all pages, the 'Add Page' block you can add anywhere on your site. 

Create links to pages by enclosing the page name in double square brackets '[' and ']' on any wiki page and a link to the page will appear. I the page doesn't exist, the link will allow you to create the new page. You can also enable CamelCase page names and using a CamelCase word or phrase in a page will create a link to a page.

You can create a hierarchy of pages by using the Parent page field for each page. This will enable the breadcrumb links at the top of every wiki page.

Create profiles for editors, readers and administrators, as well as the ability to add comments and view a page's history. Each page will be assigned a profile to enable these features.

Create a table of contents for your wiki using the visibility field in combination with the TOC block. To hide a page from the TOC block, set its visibility to 0. Any other positive number will set the sort order (weight) of the page in the table of contents block.

The SideContent block displays content based on the current page being viewed. Assign a page title to the side content field for a page and enable the SideContent block. When the main page is displayed, the related content page will display in the block.

SimplyWiki can store multiple versions of a page (revisions), allowing you to track the history and changes to a page. You can also comment on the changes made for each revision.

Longer pages can be split into multiple pages, using the pagebreak tag in your text. Automatic pagination is displayed on wiki pages that span multiple pages.

Notifications are available for a number of events - new pages, changes to a page, global notifications for changes to any page, and notifications when a previous version of a page is restored.

You can name the install directory any name you'd like (wiki, faqs, wiwimod, etc)

It supports multiple languages, even right-to-left languages
